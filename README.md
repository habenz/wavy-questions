# Wiggle Script

See the deployed version here: [https://wavy-questions.netlify.app/](https://wavy-questions.netlify.app/)

The initial vision for this animation was really simple: I just wanted text that wiggled side to side instead of up and down. After several failed google searches and a wildly inefficient React version, I settled on HTML Canvas and vanilla JS.

Have fun, play with the numbers, wiggle with joy!
